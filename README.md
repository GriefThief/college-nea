My NEA project for my Computer Science course. This is a web-based attendance system.

An RFID scanner is connected that is run on a raspberry pi. This same raspberry pi runs the website, but this is not required.

This project hosts a website that presents a database of student data that can be accessed locally. It is designed to be used as an attendance system where students can use their ID badges to sign in or out and in an emergency fire marshals can use the website to instantly see who is signed in or out of each tutor group.
